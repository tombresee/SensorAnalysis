##  Nodes Network
- The nodes allow the city to track vehicle and pedestrian collisions to understand which intersections or traffic flows lead to pedestrian deaths and make urban planning changes accordingly.
- Chicago has one of the worst incidences of asthma mortality in the country; the nodes can help monitor air pollutant levels across the city and take appropriate measures where necessary.
- Time-stamped pickup and drop-off data on 230mm total trips from both taxies and rideshare apps provide a wealth of information on how residents move through the city, which the city can use to improve efficiency of city operations.
- The nodes can be used for different purposes depending on the area: the Chicago West and South sides commonly have flooding issues during rainstorms, and the nodes can be used to detect standing water, thus helping city employees identify bottlenecks in the cityâ€™s sewer system.
